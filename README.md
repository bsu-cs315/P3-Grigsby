### Reflection
I had some difficulty completing the tutorial.  By the time I was done with it, I didn't think I had enough time to finish the other part of the project, so I decided to just submit the completed tutorial.  The biggest problem I had was I kept missing little parts of the instructions and therefore making mistakes.  I've been trying to improve my ability to read directions properly for a while though.  I should get a C.
